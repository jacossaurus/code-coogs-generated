The goal of this is to automatically generate types and data when files are changed in specific Google Drive folders. This automates the workflow, taking responsibility off of the Software team to consistently, and manually, add small data changes.

This approach was taken to (1) minimize costs, (2) prevent unnecessary API requests on website load, and (3) integrate directly with GitHub Actions.
